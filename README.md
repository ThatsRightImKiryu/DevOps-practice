[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=%97a4fff7&lines=General+Description)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

It's a repo for my practicing DevOps stuff.

My main target specialization is to learn Docker(Compose, Dockerfile, CLI),
Yandex Cloud(Administrating cloud storages and instances using their own free course), Ansible(creating playbooks), Terraform(creating instances in more efficient way), Zabbix(architecture and basics), CI/CD(GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.yml).

Also have a strong confidence in TCP/IP network model through all of the levels learning with Cisco Packet Tracer troubleshooting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Studing Yandex Cloud and DevOps techniques on my own.

#

## Yandex Cloud Course "Cloud Engineer"

__Beginning__

_Learnt basics of:_
+ Creating VMs and connecting to them;
+ Creating recovery of disk and VMs;
+ Creating taget groups and instance groups;
+ Networking: IPs, routing;
+ Load balancing(interesting one).

__Data Analyze__

_This topic consists of:_

+ Creating clusters;
+ Creating and configuring object storage;

#

## Zabbix
It is a system solution for monitoring servers. </br>

The architecture consists of:
+ Server;
+ Web interface;
+ Proxy;
+ Agent (optional);
+ DB.

Description:

Zabbix is lightweight, easy to configure initially, and has powerful functionality when working with distributed monitoring.
For example, using Pacemaker/Corosync, DRBD together to manage nodes.
Or use encryption via ssh.


But Zabbix has several _disadvantages_:

1. No encryption; Fixed by protocols like __ssh__;
2. Requires heavy configuration to increase functionality. For example, setting up __high availability clusters__;
3. When working, it requires the deployment of more complex databases, such as __PostgreSQL__ or __MySQL__;
4. The database also requires __partitioning__ to store monitoring data and process it faster.
